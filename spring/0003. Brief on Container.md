# Brief on Spring Container
`org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` is an Interface which represents the Spring container and is responsible for Initialization, Configuration and assembling bean. Implementations of this class will help Spring container to read instructions from configuration metadata like XML (Was primarily used  in 1.X to 3.x now annotation are used more widely), Java Annotation(Was added in Spring 2.5) and Java Based configurartin (3.X and above)

There are various implemenatation classes for above mentioned Interface like `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext` etc. In Spring core, to enable support for Java annotation or Java code we still need to add a small amount of XML file to instruct the same.

With increasing popularity of Spring now many IDE does support the Spring XML generation on Single click which gives the bare minimum XML just to enable our requirements like web-application.xml with Java annotation support.

Below image sourced directly from document[^1] is a good representation of how Spring Binds our class with Instructions from configuration metadata to create spin up our application.

## Configuration Metadata
Its a set of Instruction given by developer on how we want Spring container to instantiate, configure and assemble objects for our project

Spring configuration will have atleast one basic thing i.e. bean which In XML can be shown as `<bean>` residing under `<beans>` tag, similarly for annotation it will be a method annotated with `@Bean` residing under class level annotation `@Configurartion`

These bean definations is actually our object definantion which we would require in our application.

Spring also provide flexiblity to add the Objects created outside contatiner to be used by container using AspectJ integrations

> Need to link an example for the same, as per doc it is available at [Using AspectJ to dependency-inject domain objects with Spring](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#aop-atconfigurable).

A very come line to instantiate Spring container is as below
```java
ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("services.xml", "daos.xml");
```
In above example we are showing how we can set instruction in two xml files i.e. services and daos.xml placed in classpath and create Spring container out of that.

Once our Spring container is up, if we want to access an Object i.e. Bean in context of Spring then all we need to do is call getBean method of context passing the Class or bean name.
