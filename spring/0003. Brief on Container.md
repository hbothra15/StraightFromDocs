# Brief on Spring Container
`org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext` is an Interface which represents the Spring container and is responsible for Initialization, Configuration and assembling bean. Implementations of this class will help Spring container to read instructions from meatdata like XML (Was primarily used  in 1.X to 3.x now annotation are used more widely), Java Annotation(3.x and above) and Java code (3.X and above)

There are various implemenatation classes for above mentioned Interface like `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `FileSystemXmlApplicationContext` etc. In Spring core, to enable support for Java annotation or Java code we still need to add a small amount of XML file to instruct the same.

With increasing popularity of Spring now many IDE does support the Spring XML generation on Single click which gives the bare minimum XML just to enable our requirements like web-application.xml with Java annotation support.
