# Spring Framework Overview
Many of those who have worked with Java / Kotlin must have the heard about the Spring Framework. We all know that in current time this is the best framework to go If we are looking for any new development in Java world.

I personally has always thought that Spring is an alternative to Java EE (Enterprise edition), but the very first line page of the doc[^1] says its not a competitor but it is just a complementary. As the doc says they have not entirely embraced the Java EE specifications, but has used only selected specifications to bring out the flexibility at its peak.

Below are the List of Specifications which Spring has taken from Java EE.
-   Servlet API ([JSR 340](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=340))
-   WebSocket API ([JSR 356](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=356))
-   Concurrency Utilities ([JSR 236](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=236))
-   JSON Binding API ([JSR 367](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=367))
-   Bean Validation ([JSR 303](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=303))
-   JPA ([JSR 338](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=338))
-   JMS ([JSR 914](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=914))
-  Dependency Injection ([JSR 330](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=330))
- Common Annotations ([JSR 250](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=250))

> Will try to go over this specifications in coming notes,

**Minimum requirements for Spring** : Frankly never thought they have any such limitations as we always keep on updating, but they do. For Spring-5 minimum requirement is what we have in Java EE 7 which on a high level are as below

- Servlet 3.1 and above
- JPA 2.1 and above

> Will try to get the entire list  on the same and update this page

### Spring's Design Philosophy
1. Provide choice for Development team at every level
2. Accommodate diverse perspectives
3. Maintain strong backward compatibility
4. Care about API design
5. Set high standards for code quality

> Wil try to come up with various example around each philosophy aprt from what we have in docs to have more insight knowledge on each

I do have some todo pointers in this but will surely try to get those done, but on a high-level that is what we have in Very first page of Spring Framework Overview
