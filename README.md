# The Beginning
Over many years, I have been thinking to start my own blog, but as most of us always feel we have something on higher priority may it be work or personal.

In this odd times (Year 2020 - COVID ERA), many of us had got some breather to finally do what we wanted to do. As many of us who are part of IT world, might have heard the docs are important source of Information, hence I thought why not to go in depth and analyze them and try to bring the the concise knowledge, you can assume it to be more like my notebook where I will try to keep note of all things which are Important from my perspective but I am also open to have further discussion If you want to add some thing, after all sharing is caring.

In this blog I will keep trying to add info from and around Java, Vue, JavaScript, GIT, etc.

Will also try to keep a log book where If i get hold to some tricks and tips will share the same.

With this I would like to start my journey and I would love to listen to your thoughts and suggestions.
