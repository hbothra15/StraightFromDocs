# Intro to Spring Container and Beans
One of the main reason why Spring got an instant hit in all application regardless small or big, was of IOC design pattern. Spring uses its container to initialize beans and provide the dependencies to each other via this container. Spring Container is built on top of Spring's Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) technologies, which has been designed to make it easier to understand and to achieve at min 80% of AOP standards of Java enterprise. Spring also provides AspectJ's implementation which is as of now the richest in terms of feature and maturity As per docs[^1] Spring IoC is also known as DI(Dependency Injection), which I think is not the correct because DI is a sub-module of IoC, please have a look to below graph to understand in a better way. ![IoC and DI graph](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2JkcEGnJVrY/UZCDAoPjk8I/AAAAAAAAEgQ/ilz1zM5fc78/s1600/3rd+image.jpg)As per this diagram, IoC can be achieved via any 4 ways way and DI is one of the approaches which again can be achieved via Constructor Injection, Property injection and Method Injection and Spring provide support for all this DI's submodule. In Spring whenever Object ios created they define their dependencies i.e. other Object which they might require when they are working on some task via constructer, via. factory method or via properties post construct of its own (method injection). It is the responsible of Spring container to provide the required dependency when creating Object of the same which in Spring is known as a bean. In normal Java application a class would require the dependency to be provided at the time of the creation of Object and that process was handled by each class on their own, but in Spring this responsibility is delegated to Container, thus IoC is achieved. Spring's container primarily depends on `org.springframework.beans` and `org.springframework.context` packages and among those `BeanFactory` is the interface which responsible to provide advance configuration mechanism capability to manage any type of Object. If you have worked with Spring's hello world you would have surely encountered `ApplicationContext` class which is one of the sub-implementation (Abstract class) of `BeanFactory`. They provide below features 1. Easier Integration with Spring's AOP. 2. Message resource handling (Used for Internationalization) 3. Event publication 4. Application - layer-specific implementation like `ClassPathXmlApplicationContext`, `WebApplicationContext`, `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` etc. I know I am repeating again but Spring beans are Objects which are created, assembled (i.e. provide required dependencies) and managed by Spring container > Will try to link Hello world project so that can be linked to this page
